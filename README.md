<h1> Stimulating Brownian Motion </h1>

<h2>Brownian Motion</h2>
Brownian Motion is the random movement of particles in a fluid due to their collision with
other atoms or molecules. Certain robot applications like exploration, coverage and swarm
dynamics require the use of Brownian Motion. This challenge requires me to implement
and simulate Brownian Motion type behavior on a robot.
Steps:

- The robot in the challenge is considered to be a point/circle.
- The robot can be assumed to be present in a square boundary (arena).
- The robot starts in the middle of the arena and moves straight at the start.
- Mostly the robot would keep moving forward. On collision with the boundary, the robot would rotate for a random duration and then keep moving forward in the set direction.

The stimulation was done using pygame and numpy libraries. The code is very easy to understand. Hit me up if you find any
discrepancy with the code or suggest the improvements.
